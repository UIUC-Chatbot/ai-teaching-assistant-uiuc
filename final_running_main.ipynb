That is because there are not many examples of it existing. Even fewer exist today than when Turing wrote that famous statement.</p>\n",

For example, the programming language Java uses <code>static</code> types which were created by Von Neumann to prevent ambiguity. A static type allows you to declare your object as if it didn't belong to any single program code and thus prevents conflicts between programs since they cannot reference the same object in two different ways at once.[1] In turn, one could argue that the very concept of having multiple programs that share something is itself an extension of a nonlocal representation of information represented as a dynamic set of state\n",

      "  > The Turing Machine was invented during a time when computers were less sophisticated and more expensive than they are today (1962). I believe that even with all its flaws it is still a very effective way to program computer systems.

Do the two modes differ from one another? Can youthink of instances where you have worked on something which could not function without someone else assistingyou? If so, what kinds of things do you often accomplish by yourself and those tasks which needa bit extra assistance?\n",
