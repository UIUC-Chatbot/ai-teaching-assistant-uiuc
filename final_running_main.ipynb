      "[\"Beginning with the state 0000, at the rising clock edge, the left (S_0)flip-flop toggles to 1.  The second (S_1) flip-flop sees this change as afalling clock edge and does nothing, leaving the counter instate 0001.  When the next rising clock edge arrives, the leftflip-flop toggles back to 0, which the second flip-flop sees as arising clock edge, causing it to toggle to 1.  The third (S_2) flip-flopsees the second flip-flop's change as a falling edge and does nothing,and the state settles as 0010.  We leave verification of the remainder of the cycle as an exercise.\", 'The signal A in the timing diagram is an output from the FSM, andindicates whether or not the coin should be accepted.  This signal controls the servo that drives the gate, and thus determines whetherthe coin is accepted (A=1) as payment or rejected (A=0) and returnedto the user.', \"A Mealy implementation of the FSM appears on the left below, andan example timing diagram illustrating the FSM's behavior is shown onthe right.\", 'More aggressive gating strategies are also used in modern designs, butthese usually require more time to transition between the on and off states and can be moredifficult to get right automatically (with the tools), hencehardware designers may need to provide high-level information abouttheir designs.  A flip-flop that does not see any change in its clockinput still has connections to high voltage and ground, and thus allowsa small amount of { leakage current}.  In contrast,with { power gating}, the voltage difference is removed, and the circuit uses no power at all.  Power gating can be tricky---as you know,for example, when you turn the power on, you need to make sure thateach latch settles into a stable state.  Latches may need to be initialized to guarantee that they settle, which requires time afterthe power is restored.', 'In practice, when such timing guarantees are needed, the designer simplyadds state to the FSM to accommodate the need, and the problem is solved.']\n",

      "The Moore machine is a type of finite state machine (FSM) that has two states: a {1-bit} high state and a {1-bit} low state. The {1-bit} high state is used to store logic values, and the {1-bit} low state is used to store 0s and 1s. In this section, we illustrate the use of the Moore machine in a design problem. We begin with a description of the FSM, which is based on work by G. Moore (1925-2006). Moore was a pioneer in the field of logic design and is credited with inventing the FSM in the 1950s. After working at Fairchild Semiconductor, Moore founded his own company, Moore Engineering, in 1962. The company was acquired by General Electric in 1979, and Moore became vice president of design engineering at GE in 1982. In 1984, Moore co-authored a book with E. L. Doctorow, The Art of Computer Programming, which became a best-seller. Over the next two decades, Moore's work helped lead to the development of the microprocessor and the digital computer.

      "The Moore machine is a counter that counts in units of bits. The number of bits in a bit is determined by the design of the counter, but can range from 0 to 255 (a value of 10-bits is common). When the counter reaches a value of 0, it stops counting and restarts at 1, where it stays until it runs out of bits, which can take a few seconds in real life.

Well, we could use a flip-flop to hold the value of 10 and move the input to the flip-flop after counting for a number of seconds, but that's a lot of logic for a counter that size. Instead, we can use what is known as a transition table to determine the order in which the bits in the counter should change. As the name implies, a\n",
