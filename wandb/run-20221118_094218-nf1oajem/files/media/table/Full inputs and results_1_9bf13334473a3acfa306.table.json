The machine consists of two parts: a state machine and a logic function. The state of the machine is represented by a set of bits, and the logic function is a function that takes a state bit and produces one of two outputs, Z=1 or Z=0.

The machine has two inputs and one output, and can perform any of the operations defined for an integer in the program. In other words, the Turing machine can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as logical equivalence checking. The outputs are in the form of integers, which can be used as inputs to other machines in the system.

It is one of the most important concepts in computer science. The Turing machine has been used to model almost every type of logic function, and is the basis for many of the algorithms that we use in computing today. In this section, we illustrate the concept of a Turing machine with an example of a counter. We begin with the simplest form of a counter, one that counts downward and stops when it reaches 0. Then we move on to more complex forms, such as those that add or subtract, and finally to functions that perform operations on numbers. We show that any computer with a memory can be thought of as a Turing machine, and that this understanding can help us design better computers. The section ends with a discussion of the limitations of the approach that we have taken, and how we might improve it.\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eBackground\\u003c\\/strong\\u003e\\u003cspan\\u003e \\u003c\\/span\\u003eTuring machines were invented in 1872 by Alan Turing, who is considered to be the father of artificial intelligence.", "Note that (2^N=0)  2^N, and add this equation to Equation () to obtain", -1.011551856994629, 43.94237835519016], ["what is Turing machine ?", "", "The Turing machine is a machine that mimics the behavior of a human brain.

For example, if you are building a spacecraft, and want it to have the ability to land on another planet, you could give the computer the task of deciding whether to land or not. Another way is to give the computer control of a weapon. In World War II, Germany developed a system known as the Enigma machine. The machine was designed to encrypt messages, and was impossible for humans to break. In order to break the machine, computers had to be programmed with patterns of letters and numbers that looked like the patterns that an Enigma machine produced. Once the patterns were known, humans could break the machines.
