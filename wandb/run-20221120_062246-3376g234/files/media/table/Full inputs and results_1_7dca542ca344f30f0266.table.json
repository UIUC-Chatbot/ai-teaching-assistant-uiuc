He was sentenced to two years in prison, but was released in 1939 after the Second World War began. After returning to England, he worked at Bletchley Park, where he developed codebreaking techniques that were used to break the Enigma machine, which was used by the Nazis to communicate with the outside world. In 1950, he married Irene Noyes, and they had two children. In 1954, he was awarded the Turing Award for his work on cryptography, which led to the development of computer programs that are still used today.

He is best known for his work on logic and cryptology, but he also played an important role in the development of computer science. In this context, we refer to Turing's work as 'Turingism', which is the name given to the idea that computers should be able to perform logic functions, such as addition and subtraction, as well as logical equivalence checking (whether two expressions written in different languages are equivalent). Turing developed a system for calculating equations in which variables were represented as numbers, which he called 'binary logic'. This system was used to solve problems in algebraic topology, and is still used today in applications such as number theory (the study of sets and functions) and algebraic geometry (the study of lines and curves). The question asks what is the relation between Alan Turing and computers. The answer gives an overview of Turing's work and some of the issues that he addressed. It also explains why it", "Finally, be aware that people often overload the term 2's complementand use it to refer to the operation of negation in a 2's complementrepresentation.  In our class, we try avoid this confusion: 2's complementis a representation for signed integers, and negation is an operationthat one can apply to a signed integer (whether the representation usedfor the integer is 2's complement or some other representation for signedintegers).", 0.39365941286087036, 45.46506795473397], ["who is Alan Turing ?", "", "Alan Turing was a British mathematician. He is best known for his work on logic and computer science. In the 1950s, he proved that there is a machine that can perform the Turing test, which is a way of checking whether a computer can think like a human. He also developed one of the first computers, which he used to solve a problem for the Ministry of Defence. After that, he became a pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI). Today, AI is a hot topic in science and has the potential to improve our lives in many ways. The BBC's Four Corners programme in 2013 revealed that Turing was gay, which led to a wave of anti-gay violence in the UK at the time. The government responded by introducing legislation to protect gay people from discrimination in the workplace and in housing. In 2015, the House of Lords voted to remove the ban on gay men serving in the armed forces, but the bill was not passed by the House of Commons before the end of that year.
