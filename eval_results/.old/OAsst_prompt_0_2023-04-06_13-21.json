        "Question": "What tools can we use to debug LC3 programs? Assuming the program compiles but does not function as expected.",
        "Original-Ground-Truth": "Using the LC3 simulator, we can step through our program line by line and observe how our register and memory values change each step, and compare that with how the program is expected to function. To speed up the process, we can set up breakpoints to skip through the parts of the program that we know are working fine. Another debugging tool is to print the values to screen by loading it into R0 and using the OUT command.",
        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "There are several tools that can be used to debugLC3 programs:\n\n1. Simulator: You can use an emulator or a simulator to run the program and observe its behavior. An emulator is a software program that mimics the hardware environment of a computer, allowing you to run programs on a different platform. A simulator can be used to run the program and observe its behavior under different conditions, such as different memory sizes or different processor architectures.\n\n2. Debugger: A debugger is a software program that allows you to step through your program and observe its state. A debugger can be used to identify and fix bugs in your program. Some debuggers provide features such as breakpoints, watchpoints, and memory debugging tools that can help you identify and fix problems in your program.\n\n3. Compiler: A compiler is a software program that translates a program written in a high-level language into machine code. A compiler can help you identify and fix bugs in your program by providing information about the processor instructions that the program is executing.\n\n4. Profiling: A profiler is a software program that measures the performance of a program. A profiler can help you identify areas of your program that are taking a long time to execute and suggest ways to optimize those areas.\n\n5. Memory debugger: A memory debugger is a software program that can help you identify and fix memory errors in your program. A memory debugger can help you identify memory leaks, dangling pointers, and other memory-related issues.\n\nIt's important to note that debugging a program can be a complex and time-consuming process, and it's important to have a good understanding of the tools and techniques available. Additionally, it's important to have a good understanding of the code you are working on and to have a good understanding of the hardware and software environment in which you are working.",

        "Question": "How can I use a 4:1 mux to represent a 3-input boolean function?",
        "Original-Ground-Truth": "First draw a truth table with variables A,B,C and output P. Then group together the conditions that have the same A and B values, such that there are four different groups with 2 conditions in each group. Then determine an expression for P in terms of C for each group,  and those 4 expressions will be the 4 inputs to the MUX. The two select inputs will be A and B.",
        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "To represent a 3-input boolean function using a 4:1 mux, you can use the truth table in Figure 3.14 to determine the output for each combination of input values. Then, you can use the mux to select the output for a particular combination of input values. For example, if you want to represent the function f(a, b, c) = a && b && c, you can use a 4:1 mux to select the output based on the values of a, b, and c. The truth table in Figure 3.14 shows that the output for a = 0, b = 0, and c = 0 is 0, while the output for a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1 is 1. Therefore, you can use a 4:1 mux to represent the function f(a, b, c) = a && b && c by selecting the output based on the values of a, b, and c using the truth table in Figure 3.14.",
