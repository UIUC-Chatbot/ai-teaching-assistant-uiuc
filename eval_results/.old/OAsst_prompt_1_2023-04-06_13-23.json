        "Question": "What tools can we use to debug LC3 programs? Assuming the program compiles but does not function as expected.",
        "Original-Ground-Truth": "Using the LC3 simulator, we can step through our program line by line and observe how our register and memory values change each step, and compare that with how the program is expected to function. To speed up the process, we can set up breakpoints to skip through the parts of the program that we know are working fine. Another debugging tool is to print the values to screen by loading it into R0 and using the OUT command.",
        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "There are several tools that can be used to debugLC3 programs:\n\n1.  Debuggers: There are several debuggers available for x86 processors, including Intel’s Debugger, AMD’s AMD debugger, and Microsoft’s Visual Studio debugger. These debuggers can be used to step through the code, view the state of the processor, and identify any errors or issues.\n\n2.  Instrumentation Tools: There are also instrumentation tools available that can be used to collect information about the execution of the program. This information can be used to identify bottlenecks or performance issues in the code.\n\n3.  Profiling Tools: Finally, there are profiling tools that can be used to collect information about the execution of the program, including memory usage, CPU usage, and threading information. This information can be used to identify areas of the code that are taking a long time to execute and to identify any performance bottlenecks.\n\nIt is important to note that while these tools can be useful for debuggingLC3 programs, they may not be able to provide a complete solution to the problem. In some cases, it may be necessary to use a combination of these tools and techniques to identify and fix the issues in the code.",

        "Question": "How can I use a 4:1 mux to represent a 3-input boolean function?",
        "Original-Ground-Truth": "First draw a truth table with variables A,B,C and output P. Then group together the conditions that have the same A and B values, such that there are four different groups with 2 conditions in each group. Then determine an expression for P in terms of C for each group,  and those 4 expressions will be the 4 inputs to the MUX. The two select inputs will be A and B.",
        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "To represent a 3-input boolean function using a 4:1 mux, you would need to use two select lines and two input lines. The truth table for the 4:1 mux would look like this:\n\n| S1 | S2 | S3 | S4 | C |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n\nIn this truth table, S1 and S2 select the first input line, S3 and S4 select the second input line, and C represents the result of the addition. The truth table shows that when S1 and S2 are both 0, the result of the addition is 0, when S1 and S2 are both 1, the result of the addition is 1, and when S1 is 0 and S2 is 1, the result of the addition is 1.\n\nTo use the 4:1 mux to represent a 3-input boolean function, you would set S1 and S2 to the values of the first input line, set S3 and S4 to the values of the second input line, and set C to the result of the addition. For example, if the first input line is 0 and the second input line is 1, you would set S1 and S2 to 0 and S3 and S4 to 1, and C would be 1.",
