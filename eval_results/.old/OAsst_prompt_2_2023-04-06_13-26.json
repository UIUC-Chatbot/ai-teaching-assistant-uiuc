        "Question": "What tools can we use to debug LC3 programs? Assuming the program compiles but does not function as expected.",
        "Original-Ground-Truth": "Using the LC3 simulator, we can step through our program line by line and observe how our register and memory values change each step, and compare that with how the program is expected to function. To speed up the process, we can set up breakpoints to skip through the parts of the program that we know are working fine. Another debugging tool is to print the values to screen by loading it into R0 and using the OUT command.",
        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "There are several tools that can be used to debugLC3 programs:\n\n1. Simulator: You can use a simulator to run the compiled program and observe its behavior. A simulator is a software program that emulates the target processor and provides a way to interact with the processorâ€™s hardware. You can use a simulator to test the compiled program and identify any errors or bugs.\n\n2. Emulator: An emulator is a software program that runs an operating system or other software environment on a different computer. You can use an emulator to run the compiled program and observe its behavior in a more controlled environment.\n\n3. Debugger: A debugger is a software program that allows you to step through your code and identify errors or bugs. You can use a debugger to view the state of the processor at any point in the program, and to modify the code to fix the problem.\n\n4. Profiling: A profiler is a software program that measures the performance of a program. You can use a profiler to identify which parts of your program are taking a long time to execute, and to optimize the code to improve performance.\n\n5. Memory debugger: A memory debugger is a software program that allows you to view the contents of the memory of the processor. You can use a memory debugger to identify any errors or bugs that may be causing the program to crash.\n\nIt's important to note that using a debugger or profiler can be time-consuming and require a good understanding of the underlying hardware and software. It's also important to make sure that you have the necessary hardware and software to run the debugger or profiler, as well as the expertise to use them effectively.",

        "Question": "How can I use a 4:1 mux to represent a 3-input boolean function?",
        "Original-Ground-Truth": "First draw a truth table with variables A,B,C and output P. Then group together the conditions that have the same A and B values, such that there are four different groups with 2 conditions in each group. Then determine an expression for P in terms of C for each group,  and those 4 expressions will be the 4 inputs to the MUX. The two select inputs will be A and B.",
        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "To represent a 3-input boolean function using a 4:1 mux, you would need to use the following truth table:\n\nA B C\n0 0 0\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n1 1 1\n\nThis truth table represents the function f(A, B, C) = A OR B OR C, where A, B, and C are 3-bit binary numbers.\n\nTo use the 4:1 mux to represent this function, you would set the select lines of the mux to the values corresponding to the truth table. For example, if you want to use the mux to represent the function f(A, B, C) = A OR B OR C, you would set the select lines of the mux to the values 0, 0, and 1, respectively.\n\nThe resulting mux would have 4 input lines and 1 output line, and it would be able to represent the function f(A, B, C) = A OR B OR C by selecting the appropriate input line based on the values of A, B, and C.",
