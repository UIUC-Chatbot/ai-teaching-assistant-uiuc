        "Question": "What is Addressability of memory?",
        "Original-Ground-Truth": "Answer Memory in modern systems is used to store variable and instructions(something more relevant when students learn LC3). These systems have properties based on the number of bits in the system. Addressability is the way computers identify different memory locations and is determined by the size of the system (also known as the number of bits in the system: 16 in LC3, 64 in x86 etc). The max available address space is calculated by taking 2^n, where n is the size of the system.",
        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "\n        Answer: Addressability refers to the ability of a computer to access and manipulate memory locations. In computer science, memory is typically divided into two types: main memory and secondary memory.\n\nMain memory is the primary storage for data and programs, and it is usually much larger than secondary memory. Main memory is usually accessible to the processor at any time, and it is used to store and retrieve data as needed.\n\nOn the other hand, secondary memory is smaller and less expensive than main memory, and it is used to store data that is not frequently needed or that is not currently being used by the processor. Examples of secondary memory include hard disks, flash memory, and solid-state drives.\n\nAddressability refers to the ability of a computer to access and manipulate memory locations.

        "Question": "What are the different steps in the LC3 assembly process?",
        "Original-Ground-Truth": "The computer does a “first pass” through the program, where it identifies the memory address of every label in the program, and then builds a symbol table. The computer then does a “second pass” through the program, where it translates the assembly language instructions into machine code.",
        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "\n        Answer:\n\n1.    The first step in theLC3 assembly process is to load the instruction into the instruction cache (L1).\n2.    The instruction is then decoded by the instruction decoder (ID).\n3.    The decoded instruction is then checked for any dependencies with other instructions in the cache.\n4.    If there are no dependencies, the instruction is fetched from the memory (L2) into the instruction cache (L1).\n5.    The instruction is then decoded by the instruction decoder (ID).\n6.    The decoded instruction is then checked for any dependencies with other instructions in the cache.\n7.    If there are no dependencies, the instruction is executed by the processor (P).\n8.    If there are dependencies, the instruction is fetched from the memory (L2) into the instruction cache (L1).\n9.    The instruction is then decoded by the instruction decoder (ID).\n10.
