        "Question": "What tools can we use to debug LC3 programs? Assuming the program compiles but does not function as expected.",
        "Original-Ground-Truth": "Using the LC3 simulator, we can step through our program line by line and observe how our register and memory values change each step, and compare that with how the program is expected to function. To speed up the process, we can set up breakpoints to skip through the parts of the program that we know are working fine. Another debugging tool is to print the values to screen by loading it into R0 and using the OUT command.",
        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "There are several tools that can be used to debugLC3 programs:\n\n1. Simulator: You can use a simulator to run the program and observe its behavior. A simulator is a software program that models the behavior of a computer system and can be used to test and debug programs. You can use an x86 simulator, such as Bochs or QEMU, to run the program and observe its behavior.\n\n2. Debugger: A debugger is a software program that can be used to step through a program and observe its state. You can use a debugger to identify and fix bugs in your program. There are several debuggers available for x86 processors, such as gdb, lldb, and Visual Studio Code.\n\n3. Profiling: You can use a profiler to analyze the performance of your program. A profiler can help you identify areas of your program that are consuming a large amount of resources and can help you optimize your code. There are several profilers available for x86 processors, such as Intel VTune and AMD CodeAnalyst.\n\n4. Memory debugger: A memory debugger can help you identify and fix memory errors in your program. A memory debugger can help you identify memory leaks, dangling pointers, and other memory-related issues. There are several memory debuggers available for x86 processors, such as Valgrind and AddressSanitizer.\n\n5. Code coverage tools: Code coverage tools can help you measure the coverage of your code. Code coverage tools can help you identify areas of your code that are not being tested and can help you improve the quality of your code. There are several code coverage tools available for x86 processors, such as Coverity and Code Climate.\n\nIt's important to note that debugging a program can be a complex and time-consuming process, and it's important to have a good understanding of the tools and techniques available. It's also important to use a combination of these tools and techniques to identify and fix bugs in your program.",

        "Question": "How can I use a 4:1 mux to represent a 3-input boolean function?",
        "Original-Ground-Truth": "First draw a truth table with variables A,B,C and output P. Then group together the conditions that have the same A and B values, such that there are four different groups with 2 conditions in each group. Then determine an expression for P in terms of C for each group,  and those 4 expressions will be the 4 inputs to the MUX. The two select inputs will be A and B.",
        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "To use a 4:1 mux to represent a 3-input boolean function, you can use the truth table in Figure 3.14 to determine the output for each combination of input values. Then, you can use the mux to select the output for a particular combination of input values. For example, if you want to represent the function \"A OR B OR C\", you can use a 4:1 mux to select the output based on the values of A, B, and C. The truth table in Figure 3.14 shows that if A = 0 and B = 0, the output will be 0. If A = 1 and B = 0, the output will be 1. If A = 0 and B = 1, the output will be 1. If A = 1 and B = 1, the output will be 0. By using the 4:1 mux to select the output, you can represent the function in a compact and efficient way.",

        "Question": "What is a 2’s complement integer used for?",
        "Original-Ground-Truth": "We use a 2’s complement integer to represent positive and negative integers that we wish to perform arithmetic on.",
        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "A 2's complement integer is used for representing signed integers in computer science. It is a way of representing negative numbers by adding a 1 to the most significant bit (MSB) of the number. This means that when you add a negative number to a 2's complement integer, the result will be a positive number.\n\nFor example, if you have a 4-bit 2's complement integer representing a signed integer -4, the MSB of the number will be set to 1, and the other three bits will be set to 0. When you add a negative number to this number, the result will be a positive number represented by the following 4-bit 2's complement integer:\n\n-4 + -1 = -5\n\nThis process of adding a 1 to the MSB of a signed integer is called \"complementing\" the number, and it is used to represent negative numbers in computer science.",
