<|prompter|>Context: LC-3 ISA A.1 Overview The instruction set architecture (ISA) of the LC-3 is defined as follows: Memory address space 16 bits, corresponding to 216 locations, each containing one word (16 bits). Addresses are numbered from 0 (i.e., x0000) to 65,535 (i.e., xFFFF). Addresses are used to identify memory locations and memory-mapped I/O device registers.

Question: What is LC-3?
Answer: The instruction set architecture (ISA) of the LC-3 is a 16-bit ISA. The architecture specifies the types of instructions and their addressing modes, as well as the size and layout of the memory space.
The instruction set includes basic arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes bitwise operations, including logical AND, logical OR, and bit shift.
The ISA also provides for memory access, including reads and writes. Memory accesses are performed using memory addresses, which are specified in terms of the base address and the displacement. The base address specifies the starting location of the memory word, while the displacement specifies the number of bits to be retrieved or written from the memory.
